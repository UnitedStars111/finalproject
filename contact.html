	<p id="largertext">ABOUT US</p>
	<p id="smallertext">We are a newly established company based in Ottawa, Canada. 
	Our goal is to provide beautiful jewelry at an affordable price for all. 
	We believe that everyone should have access to items that make them feel happy, including jewelry.</p>
	<p id="largertext">OUR METHODS</p>
	<p id="smallertext">We create jewelry through ethical means. 
	Diamonds are lab-created, and other gems are collected from sustainable and ethical mines that do 
	not take advantage of workers. Unfortunately, there aren't many of those mines left.
	Despite that, we still refuse to use gems from mines that exploit their workers, and we eat
	the extra cost of getting those gems.</p>
